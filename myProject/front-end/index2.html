 <h1>The End</h1>

<p>In the real world nowadays, that is to say, in the world of video transmissions, cellular phones, fax machines, computer networks, 
and in particular out in the humming digitalized precincts of avant-garde computer hackers, cyberpunks and hyperspace freaks, you will
 often hear it said that the print medium is a doomed and outdated technology, a mere curiosity of bygone days destined soon to be 
 consigned forever to those dusty unattended museums we now call libraries. Indeed, the very proliferation of books and other 
 print-based media, so prevalent in this forest-harvesting, paper-wasting age, is held to be a sign of its feverish moribundity, 
 the last futile gasp of a once vital form before it finally passes away forever.</p>
